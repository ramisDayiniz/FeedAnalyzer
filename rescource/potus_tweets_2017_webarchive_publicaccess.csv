The gun lobby may be holding Congress hostage, but they can't hold America hostage. We can't accept this carnage in our communities.
What's often ignored in this debate is that a majority of gun owners agree with commonsense steps to save lives.
We will keep guns out of the wrong hands, enforce our guns laws, and ensure those with serious mental illnesses get treatment.

Guns now kill as many people as cars in almost half of the U.S. We can't stop every act of violence, but we can save lives if we act.
Each year, more than 30,000 American lives are cut short by guns - two-thirds coming from suicides. Too many Americans have lost loved ones.

Slamming the door in the face of refugees would betray our deepest values. That's not who we are. And it's not what we're going to do.
Welcoming the world’s vulnerable who seek the safety of America is not new to us. We've safely welcomed 3 million refugees since 1975.
Here, our focus is giving safe haven to the most vulnerable Syrians – women, children, and survivors of torture.
We will provide refuge to at least 10,000 refugees fleeing violence in Syria over the next year after they pass the highest security checks.
We also win this fight with our values. America can ensure our own security while welcoming refugees desperately seeking safety from ISIL.
Protecting the American people is my top priority. With our 65 global partners, we're leading the campaign to degrade and destroy ISIL.

We're also increasing the number of Syrian and other refugees we admit to the U.S. to 100,000 per year for the next two years.
We've provided more than $4.5 billion in humanitarian aid to help meet the needs of those impacted by the Syrian conflict.
Nearly 12 million people have been displaced by the conflict in Syria. As Americans, we can't sit idly by. That's not who we are.

Despite what the critics will tell you, this plan will ultimately save the average American family nearly $85 a year on their energy bills.
Thanks to this plan, there will be 90,000 fewer asthma attacks among our kids and we'll avoid 3,600 premature deaths in 2030.
It's time to change that. With the Clean Power Plan, by 2030, carbon pollution from power plants will be 32% lower than it was a decade ago.
Right now, power plants account for about one-third of America’s carbon pollution. That’s more than our cars, airplanes, and homes combined.
Levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere are higher than they’ve been in 800,000 years. 2014 was the planet’s warmest year on record.

Hey @StationCDRKelly, loving the photos. Do you ever look out the window and just freak out?
Launching a pilot program to help students in prison pay for college, because everyone willing to work for it deserves a second chance.
Happy 50th birthday, Medicare and Medicaid! Two programs, one promise: that every American deserves a basic measure of dignity and security.
25 years of the ADA and Americans with disabilities are breaking more barriers than ever, making all of us more free. Let's keep going.
Proud to be the first American President to visit Kenya. Happy to see family, and to talk with young Kenyans about the future.
E.L. Doctorow was one of America's greatest novelists. His books taught me much, and he will be missed.

Congrats to Oregon on passing two years of free community college! Every hardworking student deserves access to higher education.
Pluto just had its first visitor! Thanks @NASA - it's a great day for discovery and American leadership. http://t.co/FfztBSMbK0
Good conversation with Tom Friedman on the deal we reached with Iran. It's a major step toward a safer world.  https://t.co/xwSrH9IoFG
Mass incarceration doesn't work. Let's build communities that give kids a shot at success and prisons that prepare people for a 2nd chance.
We could eliminate tuition at every public college and university in America with the $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations.
The $80 billion we spend each year on incarcerations could double the salary of every high school teacher in America.
The $80 billion we spend each year to keep people incarcerated could pay for universal pre-K for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old in America.
In 1980, there were 500,000 people in American jails. Today, there are 2.2 million. Many belong. But too many are nonviolent offenders.
America keeps more people behind bars than the top 35 European countries combined.
America is home to 5% of the world's population, but 25% of the world's prisoners.
Just spoke to the NAACP about criminal justice reform, something many broadly agree on. Some stats:
South Carolina taking down the confederate flag - a signal of good will and healing, and a meaningful step towards a better future.
What a win for Team USA! Great game @CarliLloyd! Your country is so proud of all of you. Come visit the White House with the World Cup soon.

It doesn't get much better than celebrating America with the people you love. Happy Fourth of July, everyone!

Today is a big step in our march toward equality. Gay and lesbian couples now have the right to marry, just like anyone else. #LoveWins
The uninsured rate is the lowest it's ever been. Let's keep at it until every American has quality, affordable health insurance.
More than 137 million Americans have guaranteed access to preventive care like cancer screenings and birth control at no out-of-pocket cost.
Women can no longer be charged more for health coverage just for being women.
129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied health coverage.
More than 16 million Americans have gained health coverage after 5 years of the Affordable Care Act.
Today's decision is a victory for every hardworking American. Access to quality, affordable health care is a right, not a privilege.
Good luck Team USA – make us proud out there! #OneNationOneTeam http://t.co/btu3dRXPbr
Expressions of sympathy aren’t enough. It’s time we do something about this.
Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel.
Good point, Mitt. https://t.co/Ryusfp8Xbh
